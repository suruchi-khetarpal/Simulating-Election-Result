# Simulating-Election-Result
Simulating the outcome of an election based on a simple probabilistic model estimated from polls data. Assume that there are two political parties, which we refer to as the Democrats and the Republicans. There is a number of regions participating in the election, and each region has a certain number of delegates that can be awarded to one of the two parties. Within each region, the party receiving the most votes will be awarded all of the delegates from that region. Assume also that the number of votes each party receives within each region is drawn from a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation.
